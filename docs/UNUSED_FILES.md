The following files were identified as likely backups or duplicates and have been marked with a header comment indicating they are unused backups. Review these and delete if you agree.

- `ai_agents/db copy.py`
- `ai_agents/db copy 2.py`
- `crew/crew_manager copy.py`
- `main copy.py`
- `config copy.yaml`

These files were left in the repo but prefixed with a clear comment to avoid accidental use. If you'd like I can move them to a `archive/` folder or delete them entirely after your review.
